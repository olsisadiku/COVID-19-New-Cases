# COVID-19-New-Cases
Using python to scrape, https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/, I create a plot of new cases daily and will be adding a moving average later. The intention for this code is to later on add a predictive modeling for it with the use of data from other existing viruses.
